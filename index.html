                info@hackriddle.com!

                <h5>Who can attend?</h5>
                HackRiddle is open to any undergraduate at any college. Non-ERAU Students must be at least 18 years
                old. Unfortunately, at this time, high schoolers (who are younger than 18 years old) cannot attend.

                <h5>What if I don't have a team?</h5>
                Dont worry! We will have team forming events that will help you bring together your dream team! Feel

                <h5>Do you provide hardware?</h5>

                <h5>Is there a Code of Conduct?</h5>
                We want all hackers to have a great time at HackRiddle, so we will be using the MLH Code of Conduct. <a

                Unfortunately, all work on your hacks must be done during the 24 hour event. Projects that have been
                worked on before the start of the event won't be allowed to enter for judging.
