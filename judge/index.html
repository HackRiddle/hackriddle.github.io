				<h4>Judge Hack<b>Riddle</b></h4>
				
				<h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>
                 	We will be hosting the school’s first ever 24-hour collegiate hackathon this upcoming October 2016.  Hackathons are events that draw students from across a variety of majors, with a focus on computer science and general engineering.  This event will last for 24 hours, which involves students collaborating on software and hardware projects that must be started and completed within that time frame.  In order to make our event a success, <b>we need your help!</b></p><p> You are reading this because we think that you would make an awesome addition to our panel of judges.  Our judges are not only the deciding factor in the competition, but an integral part of the student's perception of the event.	
				</p>
				
				<h5>Expectations</h5>
                <ol>
                <li>
					 Judges are required to be at the event for the full judging and exposition session. Judging will begin at <u>12:45 PM EST on October 16th</u> and end at approximately <u>3:30 PM EST the same day</u>.
				</li>
					<li>
					Judges are also required to attend a judge’s meeting prior to the start of the judging period. Judges will be able to review the rubric and project criteria with the organizers and other judges. This meeting will occur about 30 minutes prior to the judging/exposition period that Sunday. The rubric and other judging criteria will be sent out to all judges for review prior to the weekend of the event. Lunch will be served at this time.

					</li>
					<li>
						Judges must be able to make unbiased and fair decisions regarding which teams will be awarded a prize at the end of the event. Please do not pursue this opportunity if you have any overbearing conflict of interest related to student projects.
					</li>
					
				</ol>
				
				<h5>Logistics</h5>
				<p>
					Project presentations for the participating teams at HackRiddle will take place in the form of a tabled exposition. This means that upon submitting a project, teams will be assigned a table to present from and then escorted to our exposition venue. 
                </p>
				
                <p>
                 	There is free parking available at the venue, and directions will be provided upon confirmation of judging.
                </p>
				<p>
					Lunch will served to our judges prior to the judging period.
